Dear Sir/Madam

I am currently in my eleventh year as a software engineer in the design, development and maintenance of Enterprise software solutions.  During this time I primarily used C#, TSQL, .Net, MS SQL Server, Visual Studio, and VB to write customizations and integrations for the SAGE and Acumatica ERP systems.  I have contributed and managed the entire sofrtware cycle as well as helped consultants suss out technological solutions.  I think I could be a real asset to the Nordstroms team and would love the opportunity to bring my skillset to bear on one organization's needs in a more comprehensive way.

Thank you for your consideration
Patrick Chen
